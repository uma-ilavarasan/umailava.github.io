        <p><br>Hello!<br><br>
        
          I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Government at Harvard University and a Malcolm Wiener Ph.D. Research Fellow in 
          Poverty and Justice through the <a href="https://inequality.hks.harvard.edu">Harvard Stone Program in Wealth Distribution, Inequality, 
          and Social Policy</a>. I am also an affiliate of the <a href="https://caps.gov.harvard.edu/directory/uma-ilavarasan/">Center for American 
          Political Studies</a>, the <a href="https://www.iq.harvard.edu/people/uma-m-ilavarasan">Institute for Quantitative Social Science</a>, 
          and the <a href="https://ces.fas.harvard.edu/people/uma-ilavarasan">Minda de Gunzburg Center for European Studies</a>,
          as well as a Graduate Student Associate at the <a href="https://www.wcfia.harvard.edu">Weatherhead Center for International Affairs</a>.<br><br>
          
          I study American and comparative politics, with a focus on American political development, comparative political economy, bureaucratic politics,
          and social and industrial policy. In my dissertation, I explore how and when states (the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union) wield 
          <em>monopsonistic power</em> to achieve programmatic goals. I focus specifically on the development of labor and environmental policy within 
          the crucible of the government contract. I employ interviews, archival research, and quantitative analysis in my work. <br><br>
          
          I graduated in May 2019 from Reed College with a B.A. in Economics. Between July 2021 and July 2022, I served as a Financial Economist 
          at the U.S. Department of the Treasury.<br><br>
