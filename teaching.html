        <br><h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p> I have taught graduate and undergraduate courses in quantitative methods and comparative politics. 
          In July 2025, I received a Teaching Certificate from the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. 
          In every semester I was eligible, I earned a Certificate of Distinction in Teaching, and my mean overall
          evaluation is 4.8/5.
          As a teaching fellow, I have experience with the following courses.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GOV 1114: Law & Inequality</strong> Spring 2023, Spring 2024.</li>
          <ul><li>Hybrid lecture-seminar on the comparative politics of legal design, enforcement, and evasion.</li></ul>
          <li><strong>GOV 1249: Authoritarianism</strong> Fall 2023.</li>
          <ul><li>Introductory survey of trends and patterns in authoritarian politics.</li></ul>
          <li><strong>GOV 2001: Quantitative Social Science Methods I</strong> Fall 2022.</li>
          <ul><li>First course in the Government Department's Ph.D.-level quantitative methods sequence.</li></ul>
        </ul>
        <br><p>I have advised six undergraduate theses. In May 2025, I was awarded the Harvard Government Department's Cheryl B.
          Welch Thesis Adviser Award. I also serve as a departmental concentration advisor, assisting approximately 40 students per 
          year with course selection and other aspects of their academic lives.</p>
